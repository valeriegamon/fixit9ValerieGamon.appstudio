/*
AB Scenario: You'll create a form that uses four 'new' controls that you haven't used before.

Has a new form named ABFourControls.
Uses 4 controls that haven't been used before, are interesting and not simplistic. A label is simplistic, for example.
Changes some properties of each control from the defaults. 
Do something visual and note what you changed for each control in a label on your form (so I don't overlook it).
For example, if you make something blue, say so in the label by it (ie. button background changed to blue)
Attach one event to each control, and write an event handler  for each - 
you can just output a message using a simple popup like NSB.MsgBox() if you like.
